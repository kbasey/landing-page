The Odin Project -- CSS/Flexbox Exercise Project

This is a CSS and Flexbox exercise project through The Odin Project.

A photo of a simple landing page was provided and I am to recreate the landing page using the CSS and Flexbox that I have learned along with my own creativity and problem sovling skills.
